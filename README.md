# TacoBaco

[My Notes](notes.md)

I am making a website that lets friends review different taco shops, where only their friends are able to see them. It will be in a social media style where you can post after a visit and it will stay with that specific store. As you visit shops the color of it changes, and if one of you friends visits a shop it also changes to a different color. This way you can see where you and your friends have been, get reviews you trust more, and make funny reviews using inside jokes.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features

### Elevator pitch

Are you sick of getting advice from strangers? Do you love tacos? The tacobaco website and application make it easy for friends to share experiences and reviews about tacos. It has an interactive map so you can see where your friends have been before and the reviews they left. It also has a feed so that everytime one of your friends goes somewhere you are able to see their review. This is a fun way to share opinions with your friends.
